My name is João Scholz, i am currently pursuing a degree in Statistics at the Federal University of Santa Maria, having completed a Integrated High School-level Technical Course in Internet Computing at Industrial Technical School of Santa Maria (CTISM).

Always interested in the world of data, I have acquired extensive knowledge and skills through my research scholarship as a Machine Learning Engineer at Zeit, a local startup that creates solution for the agribusiness, which i am currently still on. I am dedicated to becoming a Computer Vision Engineer and actively working on specialization projects to further advance my expertise in this domain. These projects are aimed at expanding my skill set and gaining practical experience in order to contribute effectively to the field.

Feel free to explore my projects and contributions. I am excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to the world of data and computer vision!
